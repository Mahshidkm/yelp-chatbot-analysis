# Restaurant Insight & Recommendation ChatBot

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack data science application that transforms raw Yelp reviews into actionable business intelligence and a personalized customer recommendation system. It leverages state-of-the-art NLP models to perform granular **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**, providing deep insights into what customers truly think about specific aspects (food quality, service, atmosphere, etc.) of a restaurant. These insights are presented through two intuitive dashboards: one for **restaurant owners** to track their performance and one for **customers** to find their perfect meal through a conversational chatbot.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### **For Restaurant Owners: Analytics Dashboard**
*   **Trend Analysis:** Visualize sentiment trends for key aspects (food quality, service, atmpsphere, value for money) over multiple years.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Identify strengths and weaknesses based on actual customer feedback.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Pinpoint exactly what to improve to boost ratings and customer satisfaction.

### **For Customers: Conversational Chatbot**
*   **Natural Language Search:** Find restaurants using intuitive queries like "Find a romantic Italian place with great ambiance but isn't too expensive."
*   **Aspect-Filtering:** The chatbot understands sentiment towards specific aspects, going beyond simple star ratings.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Get tailored suggestions based on nuanced customer preferences.

### **Under the Hood**
*   **Advanced NLP Pipeline:** Utilizes multiple Hugging Face Transformer models for accurate aspect extraction and sentiment scoring.
*   **Large-Scale Data Processing:** Apache Spark ensures efficient processing of the massive Yelp dataset.
*   **GPU-Accelerated Model Inference:** Slurm job scheduling manages computationally intensive NLP tasks on GPU clusters.
*   **Modern Web Application:** A responsive Flask app with a clean interface serves both dashboards seamlessly.

### **Hugging Face Models Used**
This project implements a multi-model NLP pipeline:
1.  **Aspect Extraction & Sentiment Scoring:** We used facebook/bart-large-mnli for Aspect Extraction 
and yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1 for Sentiment Scoring


2.  **Conversational Chatbot:** We used HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta
